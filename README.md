5IL INSA project : PDL-SOA
==========================


Software engineering and SOA project during final year of Engineering education.


This project provides an ESB testing tool, simulating consumers and providers using the ESB and providing KPIs to the user, like the rate of lost messages or the communication delays. The ESB tested here is OpenESB.

This project was also an opportunity to work in a team of 6 students, each one having a particular role in the team like project manager, requirements, design, tests, quality, technical coordinators. Everyone participated to the project development.


This is the implementation of the web interface of the project, used to provide a configuration file to the testing tool and to display the results to the user.
